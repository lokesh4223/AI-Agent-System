# AI Agent System - Project Overview

## Introduction

The AI Agent System is a comprehensive web application that provides users with access to various AI-powered agents for automating tasks, learning new skills, and enhancing productivity. This project is a complete conversion of a PHP-based web application to Python using the Flask framework, preserving all original functionality while implementing modern Python best practices.

## Purpose

The system aims to empower individuals and businesses with intelligent automation solutions through specialized AI agents. Users can access different agents for various purposes such as course automation, task management, writing assistance, data analysis, and more.

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication System**
   - Secure user registration with email verification
   - Login with password protection
   - Password recovery mechanism
   - Session management for secure access

2. **AI Agent Marketplace**
   - Browse and access specialized AI agents
   - Course Automation Agent for learning new skills
   - Task Assistant Agent for productivity
   - Writing Assistant Agent for content creation
   - Data Analysis Agent for insights
   - Customer Support Agent for 24/7 assistance
   - Code Assistant Agent for development tasks

3. **Course Enrollment System**
   - Schedule personalized learning paths
   - Configure notification preferences
   - Set learning duration and pace
   - Receive daily lessons via email or WhatsApp

4. **User Profile Management**
   - View account information
   - Track enrollment status
   - Access dashboard with statistics

5. **Responsive Web Interface**
   - Mobile-friendly design
   - Modern UI with Bootstrap 5
   - Interactive elements and animations

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python Flask Framework
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Email Service**: Brevo (formerly Sendinblue)
- **Authentication**: Session-based with CSRF protection
- **Security**: Password hashing with Werkzeug, Environment-based configuration

## Target Audience

- Individuals seeking to learn new skills through AI-powered courses
- Professionals looking to automate repetitive tasks
- Businesses wanting to enhance productivity with AI solutions
- Developers needing code assistance and debugging support

## System Architecture

The application follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern adapted for Flask:

- **Model**: MongoDB database with `usertable` and `course_enrollments` collections
- **View**: Jinja2 templates for HTML rendering
- **Controller**: Flask routes and utility modules for business logic

## Data Flow

1. Users register and verify their email addresses
2. Authenticated users browse available AI agents
3. Users enroll in courses and configure schedules
4. System sends daily lessons based on user preferences
5. Users can track progress and manage enrollments through their dashboard

## Scalability

The system is designed to accommodate growth:
- Modular architecture allows for easy addition of new agents
- MongoDB provides flexible data storage
- RESTful API endpoints enable integration with external systems
- Responsive design ensures compatibility across devices

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are securely hashed using Werkzeug
- CSRF protection for form submissions
- Session management for user authentication
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Input validation and sanitization

## Future Enhancements

- Team collaboration features
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- API for third-party integrations
- Additional AI agents for specialized tasks
- Mobile application development
